# indexSymantecDLPMatches

PROVIDED AS-IS
The code is a) an example and b) provided as-is, we do not know your computing environment so you need to assess the scriptâ€™s <br /> 
function and performance before implementing it. <br />


1/ Get a List of Incidents that have not been processed (using a specific Incidents Note as defined by dlpEnforceIncidentNote). <br />
You can use other artifacts, such as Incident Status. It is possible to control the number <br />
of Incidents by date or pull a certain number of incidents at a time <br />
(up to 10000 as per the API... defined by dlpEnforceIncidentPageSize). <br />
2/ With the incident list, the code makes another call to obtain each's incidents details, including the Matches. <br />
3/ The code can make bulk or individual API calls to ElasticSearch or Splunk for indexing. <br />
4/ Once the matches are in ElastiSearch, the code makes another call to the DLP Rest API to update the processed incidents by adding a note. <br />
<br />
